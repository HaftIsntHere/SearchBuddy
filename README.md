# SearchBuddy

An extension that enhances your search experience by providing instant previews of search results

## Features

- Save searched webpages in 1 click!
- See into webpages before opening them!
- Blacklist / Whitelist certain websites you want the plugin to work in (if it breaks a certain website, or you only want it for google, etc...)
- Supports both FireFox (FireFox and Zen) and Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge etc..)
- You can set the x, y, width and height offset of the preview window (minus values work too). The offset is in `px` units
- You can move any saved webpage into folders!

## How to install

- Download the repository as zip (and extract)

### Chrome (Includes chromium based)

- Go to `chrome://extensions/`
- Enable `developer mode` at the top right
- Click the `Load unpacked` button the top left
- Navigate to the extracted folder, and select the `chrome` folder

### Firefox (Includes Firefox based)

- Loading developer extensions is temporary and hence we will not be doing it.
- You can still do it but I don't recommend doing so.
- The extension is already under review in the Firefox addons store! By tomorrow you will be able to install it officially.
