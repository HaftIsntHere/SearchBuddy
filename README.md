# SearchBuddy

An extension that enhances your search experience by providing instant previews of search results

- Save searched webpages in 1 click!
- See into webpages before opening them!
- Blacklist / Whitelist certain websites you want the plugin to work in (if it breaks a certain website, or you only want it for google, etc...)
- Supports both FireFox (FireFox and Zen) and Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge etc..)
- You can set the x, y, width and height offset of the preview window (minus values work too). The offset is in `px` units
- You can move any saved webpage into folders!

## TODO

- Test extensively
